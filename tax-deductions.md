# Tax Deductions
Not much here yet

## Just a comment I copied 

Not really, but you can itemize deductions to the point of having all your income taxes returned to you. Interest paid on student loans and mortgage are 100% deductible.

Interest on Car loans used to be deductible. They are no longer. But people take a second equity mortgages or refinance with a cash out option to buy cars. Making the interest on those loans 100% tax deductible. This was part of the financial crisis remember???... everyone refinancing and buying Suburbans / luxury cars and then see their real estate value collapse? and owe more than it's worth?
