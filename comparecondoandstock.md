# Compare Condo Rental vs. Stock investment
## Need more research

This is a somewhat silly proposition to me. Remnants of the bubble era of real estate.

First, four years isn't accurate (unless you've rolled "taxes" into "other expenses"). That 13k is taxed at 25% or 28% into your personal income tax. So now at 5 or so years to recoup costs, assuming the transaction was done in cash.

Conversely, throw the money in the stock market and you're looking at sitting on $71k in 5 years instead of 50. (using the standard 8% return we've seen over a century).

Ultimately this is a more profitable choice, on top of the fact that your exposure isn't insane. Relying on one property and a service that is in legal dispute is exposed as you can get, and we're probably in a rent bubble. 11/05/13 8:45am

All true, but that assumes you buy the apartment outright. If you buy it with a mortgage, you gain a ton of leverage, and the bank takes on a good chunk of your risk exposure. Your profit goes down due to interest payments, but you offset the remaining profit with write-offs for expenses, interest and taxes. As long as it is cashflow positive it is fine.

For example, say he only puts in $10k to buy it, and gets a $30k mortgage. His gains in 5 years are roughly doubled to 16% instead of the 8% from the stock market.

Its classic real estate investing, but with the twist of daily rental instead of long term.
